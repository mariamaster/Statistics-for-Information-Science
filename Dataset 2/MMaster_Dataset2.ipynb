Furthermore, it also could mean that the cell nuclei was not normal for all of them. Lastly, the worst radius is measured by taking the mean of the largest values from the normal radius mean column. Therefore, the normal radius mean column is more susceptible to outliers and thus, this could have influenced the worst radius mean in making the final maximum value to be 36.04. "

Other characteristics such as compactness and smoothness could aso possibly be important, but it seems as though it might not be as crucial as the texture and size measurements of the cell nuclei (this can only be confirmed after analyzing the data)."
